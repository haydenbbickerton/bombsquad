	Started from the vuepack template
	Added overall structure for the board, grid, bombs, and the vuex store.
	Most of the time was spent on the board-grid.js and bomb-creator.js
	Spent more time than I should have trying to make a smooth timing function for the bomb interval, hopefully I can revisit it
	I need to move the ongoing process for pushing bombs to the grid out of the board component. I think some async would work fine but a webworker might be cleaner.
	Spent like 15 minutes checking out some free pixel art assets. In my head it looks so cute. Retro 8-bit bomberman style.

20180220: 1.5 hours
	Cleaned up the logic for queing/delaying bombs and waiting for unnoccuplied tiles to open up

20180221: 5.5 hours
	Added bins component and store
	Added bombs store
	Added logic for dragging-dropping, and triggering explosions when bomb runs out or is dropped on wrong bin.
	I need to move stuff out of the Board component, too much going on in there
	Need to add backgrounds and textures. Found some free sounds from asteroids arcade game that I used for the bombs.

20180222: 2.5 hours
	Added backgrounds and cart sprites
	Removed vue-router since it wasn't needed
