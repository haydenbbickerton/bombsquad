	Started from the vuepack template
	Added overall structure for the board, grid, bombs, and the vuex store.
	Most of the time was spent on the board-grid.js and bomb-creator.js
	Spent more time than I should have trying to make a smooth timing function for the bomb interval, hopefully I can revisit it
	I need to move the ongoing process for pushing bombs to the grid out of the board component. I think some async would work fine but a webworker might be cleaner.
	Spent like 15 minutes checking out some free pixel art assets. In my head it looks so cute. Retro 8-bit bomberman style.
